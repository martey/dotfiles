# dotfiles

This repository contains my latest attempt to synchronize my dotfiles across
various machines. See <http://dotfiles.github.com/> for more information on why
people store their dotfiles on Github.

I probably should have used one of the multitude of other homefile
synchronization projects available on the Internet, but it took more time for
me to find, evaluate, and become disillusioned with the projects I ran across
than it did for me to write my own simple script.

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/martey/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    python ~/.dotfiles/symlink.py

## Bugs
